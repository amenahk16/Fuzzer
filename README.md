# Fuzzer
Fuzzing directories is a tool for exposing hidden paths by sending a request to a target URL using a payload wordlist line by line. The request will be made to see if this page exists depending on the status code of the response

# Steps to Scan Vulnerabilities: 
- Identify the Metasploitable IP address 
- Use the Metasploitable IP address as the target URL to fuzz it â€¢
- Creating five threads to reduce running time 
- Scan the URL 
- Inject the URLs with payload wordlist line by line 
- Send GET request with the injected URLs 
- Check responds status code if it is = 200 
- Print the URLs that matched status code 200 
- Save the reachable URL after injected with payloads into a text file
